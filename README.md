# Robotic Crane Arm
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our Robotic Crane Arm project for ECE 1000.
## Project Summary
Robotic arms have been used for decades now, but most promote the concept of maneuverability.  For this project, I intended to create a robotic arm that had fewer degrees of rotation but a more structurally sound base for carrying heavy objects

## Project Capabilities 
The first iteration of the project focused on setting up the hardware systems and structure.  For the structure we created a prototype made of PLA Plastic Filament intended for fast and lightweight construction.  The first stage features:

* Microcontroller for controlling servo rotation
* 3 Servo motors to rotate and maneuver the robotic crane
* 3 capacitors meant to reduce noise from the power supply
